 * Base for HTTP clients that talk to a backend other than the Hub (a domain
 * app, the BFF, or the public web app). Only the Hub issues and refreshes
 * JWTs — domain apps, the BFF, and the web app delegate auth entirely to it
 * and never expose `/auth/refresh` themselves — so token refresh must always
 * be delegated to a Hub {@see ApiClientInterface} instance instead of the
 * inherited {@see ApiClient::attemptTokenRefresh()}, which would otherwise
 * call that missing endpoint on the secondary backend's own host.
 *
 * Both clients share the same PHP session as the Hub client, so a refresh
 * performed here is immediately visible to every client on the request.
